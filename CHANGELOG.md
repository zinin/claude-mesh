# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-mesh will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- Model policy switched from `opus` to `fable` (`claude-fable-5`): `/do-plan`
  now treats Opus as a forbidden "cheaper" model for subagent dispatch, and all
  mesh agents are pinned to `model: fable` via frontmatter.
- verify-delegation FLIP diagnostics reworded to be model-neutral.
- README: Dependencies now require a Claude Code build whose Agent tool model
  enum includes the `fable` alias.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- Initial release: ext-claude-* family, codex/gemini wrappers, mesh-review,
  mesh-design-review, session/plan helpers, check-context-size hook.

### Fixed
- check-context-size hook is now scoped to the `/do-plan` session: it no longer
  injects `ctx:` milestone reminders into ordinary sessions (which made the agent
  economize context prematurely). `/do-plan` writes a per-session config file
  `do-plan-config-<cwd>-<session>.json`; the hook emits milestone/STOP only in the
  session that owns a file. Two concurrent `/do-plan` runs in one cwd no longer
  clobber each other. Old per-cwd `do-plan-config-<cwd>.json` files (pre-change)
  have a different name and are ignored — re-run `/claude-mesh:do-plan` to re-bind.
